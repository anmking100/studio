## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke focus and concentration, inspired by the engineering context of the app. We want something professional-feeling but modern.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), offering a gentle contrast to the indigo, ensuring readability and a sense of calm. The gray helps keep the app from becoming visually overwhelming, and evokes the idea of engineering schematics.
- Accent color: Vibrant cyan (#00BCD4) is selected to highlight key metrics and interactive elements, contrasting clearly with the indigo and gray.
- Clear, sans-serif typography for readability and data visualization.
- Use minimalist icons to represent data types and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout for presenting data in an organized manner.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
